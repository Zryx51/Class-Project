# Whiteboard++

# Overview

Whiteboard++ is a collaborative online whiteboard where you and your collaborators can draw and create images to convey complex ideas or plan out projects and ideas. The application will be used by users similar to MS Paint and other raster graphics editors but also allow for real-time editing with other users akin to GoogleDocs. The primary users of the application are professional teams at companies or groups of students working on group projects.

# Application Initialization

To use this application you should have `node` and `npm` installed and issue the following commands:

1. `npm install`: this will install the required `node` libraries.
2. `npm run watch`: this will compile the application code and produce an `App.js` file in the `static` directory. This command will also continue to run until explicitly killed (e.g., control-C).
3. `npm start`: this will run the Express server, `server.js`, allowing you to view the running application in the browser window.
